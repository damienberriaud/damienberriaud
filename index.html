        <h2> About me</h2>
        <p> Since my childhood, I noticed that I am different from other people. I have been crazier, cuter, activer
            than my mates. I once forgot to bring the house key outside. When I arrived home, I noticed that I had
            to wait for other family members to come out for at least one hour. What would you do? Maybe try to call
            them, maybe try to read? I chose to do math. 1+1=2, 2+2=4, 4+4=8, etc. Do you know how does it look like
            when you have more than 100 digits? I know. That's not the only crazy story I had. I like to do sports.
            I tried to run SOLA two weeks after a severe sickness. Even though I felt my asthma, it can not stop me
            from running. I got into top 100 out of more than 1000 people. Two sips of ventolin, da la. One question
            always bothers me. Do people not swim in the river or lake in winter? They really do not know what they
            miss. Imagine fresh water from the top of mountains, olala. I did some hundred kilometers biking in Taiwan
            when the temperature was above 40 degrees (of course it's Celcius, who the hell is using Fahrenheit?) What
            else have I done? Yeah what else? I need some more feedback, please write to: s210307@icloud.com. We
            sincerely ask for more stories.</p>

                    <p>A group of n agents with numerical preferences for each other are to be
                        assigned
                        to the n seats of a dining table. We study two natural topologies: circular (cycle)
                        tables and panel (path) tables. For a given seating arrangement, an agent’s utility
                        is the sum of its preference values towards its (at most two) direct neighbors. An
                        arrangement is envy-free if no agent strictly prefers someone else’s seat, and it is
                        stable if no two agents strictly prefer each other’s seats. We show that it is NPcomplete to
                        decide
                        whether
                        an envy-free arrangement exists for both paths and
                        cycles, even with binary preferences. In contrast, under the assumption that agents
                        come from a bounded number of classes, for both topologies, we present polynomialtime algorithms
                        computing
                        envy-free and stable arrangements, working even for
                        general preferences. Proving the hardness of computing stable arrangements seems
                        more difficult, as even constructing unstable instances can be challenging. To this
                        end, we propose a characterization of the existence of stable arrangements based on
                        the number of distinct values in the preference matrix and the number of classes of
                        agents. For two classes of agents, we show that stability can always be ensured, for
                        both paths and cycles. For cycles, we moreover show that binary preferences with
                        four classes of agents, as well as three-valued preferences with three classes of agents,
                        are sufficient to prevent the existence of a stable arrangement. For paths, the latter
                        still holds, while we argue that a path-stable arrangement always exists in the binary
                        case under the additional constraint that agents can only swap seats when sitting
                        at most two positions away. We moreover consider the swap dynamics and exhibit
                        instances where they do not converge, despite a stable arrangement existing.

                    <p>In a world of finite resources, optimal allocation problems are destined to play a very central
                        role. When the allocation problem is repeated, karma mecha- nisms allow a population of
                        self-interested agents to achieve fair yet socially efficient allocations. In such schemes,
                        agents trade the immediate access to a resource for its access in the future by means of an
                        artificial karma currency in a succession of auctions. Thus far, the problem of learning an
                        optimal bidding strategy from the perspective of a single agent attracted little work. There are
                        however many results in the related ad auction literature, where the currency keeps its value
                        outside the auctions. We first study a simplified setting where karma is only issued at the
                        start of an episode and devise a simple practical strategy that is asymptotically optimal when
                        the competing bids are independent of an agent bidding behavior, which intuitively occurs when
                        the population grows large. We moreover show that the learning dy- namics that arise from the
                        simultaneous adoption of such strategies converge and that the incentive for any agent to
                        deviate unilaterally decreases to zero as the number of agents augments. We then extend our
                        analysis to support gains of karma throughout the episode and propose strategies with similar
                        guarantees of performance and convergence.
